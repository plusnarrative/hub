**Laravel Debug Bar** *- shared by Jethro May*

*It displays how many models are currently being hydrated with the goal of keeping it as low as possible. Chances are if there is a high model count being hydrated, there is a much better way of achieving the logic currently being used in the controller/model/view.*

`composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev`
